# PANet: Few-Shot Image Semantic Segmentation with Prototype Alignment

This repository contains code from the ICCV 2019 paper [PANet: Few-Shot Image Semantic Segmentation with Prototype Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.06391).

This is a recreation as part of an Image Processing class. A potential contribution is the addition of `.ipynb` notebooks meant specifically to run on Google Colab, allowing for potentially anyone to replicate the results from the original paper - given enough time and computation power.

## Getting Started
### Running On Colab
First download and upload `PANet_main.ipynb` and upload it into Colab. It should just work without problems.
By default, you will be asked to link your Google Drive account to save run results.
While not necessary, its recommended since each run is expensive.

From my experience, sometimes the imports would just not work for some reason.
I've managed to fix this on my side.
However, if anyone is having problems, please contact me [here](mailto:miguelbryancarlo@gmail.com).


### Running Locally
The original repo was meant to be run locally.
See the instructions from the original repository [here](https://github.com/kaixin96/PANet).
